//
// While we do not intend to use multiple engines at the same time, implementors
// must design engines to support running multiple sandboxes in parallel. If
// the engine can't run an unbounded number of sandboxes in parallel, it should
// return set MaxConcurrency to non-zero in its Capabilities(). Additionally,
// it must return ErrMaxConcurrencyExceeded if a sandbox is creation would
// violate it's declared MaxConcurrency. Obviously, when a sandbox is disposed
// it should be possible call NewSandboxBuilder() again.

// Obviously not all engines are available on all platforms and not all features
// can be implemented on all platforms. See individual methods to see which are

	// checking. Consumers are encouraged to just try them and handle errors
	// rather than testing for supported features up-front. Granted this is not

	// the docker image in before returning from NewSandboxBuilder(). The
	// SandboxBuilder instance returned will then reference the docker image
	// downloading process, and be ready to start a new docker container once
	// StartSandbox() is called. Obviously blocking that call until docker image
	// download is completed.

	// This operation should parse the engine-specific payload parts given in
	// SandboxOptions and return a MalformedPayloadError error if the payload
