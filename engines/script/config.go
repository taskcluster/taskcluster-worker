				Script and arguments to execute. This script will be fed
				a JSON string that matches the schema configured over 'stdin'.

				Output from the script over 'stdout' will be uploaded as task log.
				Output from the script over 'stderr' will be prefixed "[worker:error]"
				and merged with task log.

				The script will be executed with a temporary folder as
				_working directory_, this folder can be used for temporary storage and
				will be cleared between tasks.

				Files and folders stored in './artifacts/' relative to the
				_working directory_ will be uploaded as artifacts from
				the script. Hence, to make a public tar-ball artifact you create
				'./artifact/public/my-build.tar.gz' which will be uploaded as an
				artifact named 'public/my-build.tar.gz'.

				Exit codes from the script will be intepreted as follows:
				 * '0', task was executed successfully,
				 * '1', task was executed but failed,
				 * '2', task payload was not permitted, errors should be printed to stderr,
				 * '3', script had a non-fatal error, task is resolved exception
				 * '4', script had a fatal error, task is resolved exception, and
				   the worker crashes.
