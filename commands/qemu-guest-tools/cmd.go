// Package qemuguesttools implements the command that runs inside a QEMU VM.
// These guest tools are responsible for fetching and executing the task
// command, as well as posting the log from the task command to the meta-data
// service.
//
// The guest tools are also responsible for polling the meta-data service for
// actions to do like list-folder, get-artifact or execute a new shell.
//
// The guest tools is pretty much the only way taskcluster-worker can talk to
// the guest virtual machine. As you can't execute processes inside a virtual
// machine without SSH'ing into it or something. That something is these
// guest tools.

run inside the virtual machines used with QEMU engine.

The "run" (default) command will fetch a command to execute from the meta-data
service, upload the log and result as success/failed. The command will also
continuously poll the meta-data service for actions, such as put-artifact,
list-folder or start an interactive shell.

The "post-log" command will upload <log-file> to the meta-data service. If - is
given it will read the log from standard input. This command is useful as
meta-data can handle more than one log stream, granted they might get mangled.

Usage:
  taskcluster-worker qemu-guest-tools [options] [run]
  taskcluster-worker qemu-guest-tools [options] post-log [--] <log-file>

Options:
      --host <ip>  IP-address of meta-data server [default: 169.254.169.254].
  -h, --help       Show this screen.`
