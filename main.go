// Package main hosts the main function for taskcluter-worker.
//
// The code is structured in 4 kinds of extension registries. The
// commands, config, engines and plugins packages each define interfaces and
// registries where implementations of these interfaces can be registered.
//
// To add a new command to taskcluster-worker you must create new sub-package of
// commands/ which implements and registers commands.CommandProvider with the
// commands.Register(name, provider) method. The same pattern is followed for
// implementation of config transformers, engines, and plugins.
//
// All the sub-packages are then imported here, which ensure that they'll all
// be included in the respective extension registries. Exceptions to this
// pattern is the runtime and worker packages. The runtime package and its
// sub-packages implements generic abstractions and utilities to be used by all
// other packages. The worker package implements task execution flow to be used
// by commands.
