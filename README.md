A worker for TaskCluster, written in go.

This is our next generation worker, that has a pluggable architecture for
adding support for new engines (think Docker™ engine, Windows™ native engine,
OS X™ native engine, KVM™/Xen™ engine) and adding engine-independent plugins
(think livelogs, caches/volumes, auth proxies, interactive ssh/vnc).

Architecture
------------

See https://docs.taskcluster.net/reference/workers/taskcluster-worker/docs/architecture

Installing From Binary
----------------------

See https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-worker/releases

Installing From Source
----------------------

1. [Install go 1.10](https://golang.org/doc/install) or higher
2. `go get -u -t -d github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-worker/...`
3. `cd "${GOPATH}/src/github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-worker"`
4. `go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor`
5. `govendor sync`
6. `make rebuild`

Testing
-------

```
make rebuild
```

### Conditional Tests
Certain tests are disabled by default because they are:
 * only runs under certain conditions (e.g. requires root credentials),
 * requires special configuration (for example secret tokens),  
 * have system-wide side-effects (like deleting the $HOME folder), or,
 * very slow, noisy or needs fixing.

Tests that fall into one or more of these categories are enabled with build
tags. Below is a list of such build tags and description of what they test and
why these tests are disabled by default.

 * `localtunnel`, tests a `WebHookServer` implementation based on
   [localtunnel.me](https://localtunnel.me), tests are somewhat buggy and due
   to the nature of using a remote service this isn't reliable.
 * `native`, tests the native-engine, disabled because tests cleans up system
   folders such as HOME.
 * `qemu`, tests qemu-engine, disabled because it requires QEMU installed and
   needs to run as root (run tests with `./docker-tests.sh`).
 * `network`, tests network configuration for qemu-engine, disabled because it
   can leave the system in a dirty state and requires root
   (run tests with `./docker-tests.sh`).
 * `monitor`, tests sentry reporting, statsum submission and logging, requires
   credentials to run successfully.
 * `docker`, tests docker-engine, disabled because tests requires docker
   installed and must run as root (run tests with `./docker-tests.sh`).

Releasing
---------

Simply create a tag, and push to github.

```
git tag v1.0.3
